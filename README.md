# Totem Of Dying
A Fabric mod that adds a Totem of Dying to the game, inspired by a youtube comment 

## I WILL NOT MAKE A FORGE PORT
But I will backport to other fabric versions if anybody asks, altough it's not a priority for me
You're welcome to do your own port if you want to

## Totem Of Dying:
Whenever you respawn, you have a small chance of getting a Totem Of Dying
Whenever you take any damage with the totem in hand you will instantly die and respawn aat your base with your inventory and **Without** your experience

Achievements:
- Hold 2 totems (Main hand and Off Hand) and use them
- Hold a Totem Of Dying and a Totem Of Undying and see what happens!

## NOTE:
The mod currently does not check if keep inventory is on, it will nbe fixed, but for now just don't use it if you want to use keep inventory as the first time you'll use a totem, it will get turned off (and experience will be canceled regardless)
The mod was only tested on a client, so some issues may arise on the server, if so please open an issue on the github page and i'll get to fixing it as soon as possible
