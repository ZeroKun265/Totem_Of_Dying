# Totem Of Dying
A Minecraft mod that adds a Totem Of Dying to the game, inspired by a Youtube comment.

## I WILL NOT MAKE A FORGE PORT
But I will backport to other fabric versions if anybody asks, altough it's not a priority for me.
You're welcome to do your own port if you want to.

## Getting started
### How to get the totem
Whenever you respawn you have a small chance (about 5%) of getting the **Totem Of Dying**.

### The effects of the totem
Whenever you take any damage with the totem in your hand you will instantly die and respawn with your inventory and **without** your experience.

### Achievements
 - Hold 2 totems (one in the main hand and the other in the off hand) and use them
 - Hold a Totem Of Dying and a Totem of Undying and see what happens!

## Important notes
The mod currently does not check if keep inventory is on, it be fixed, but for now just don't use it if you want to use keep inventory (the mod turns it off the first time a totem is used).

The mod was only tested on a client, some issues may arise on a server (if so, please open an issue on the github page and I'll get to fixing it as soon as possible).
